# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The directory contains the run_analysis.R script. This script will process the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from [UCI](http://uci.edu). More information on the data set [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 


## How to use run_analysis.R
1. Download the dataset here [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and download into the same directory as the run_analysis.R script.
2. Optionally you can unzip the file. If you decide not to unzip the script will search for a zip files with the following name, getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip, and unzip it before continuing.
3. Run R and set the working directory to be where the script is located.
4. Source the run_analysis.R script
